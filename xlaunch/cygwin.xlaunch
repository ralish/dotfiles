    XLaunch configuration for Cygwin/X
    https://x.cygwin.com/docs/xlaunch/

    Last reviewed release: v20160530-1

    There's no XML schema seemingly available so the supported settings have
    been determined from the documentation and inspecting the source. Note as
    well that the schema available from StraightRunning is not compatible as
    it's for a different release (fork?) of XLaunch.

    |========================|
    | X server configuration |
    |========================|

    Display (integer) [:<display>]
    The unique display identifier to use given as a positive integer or zero.
    Alternatively, "-1" will use the next available display identifier.

    WindowMode (string)
    Configures how the X server will display programs:
    - MultiWindow [-multiwindow]
      Launches the X server in the background, with each program displayed as
      an individual window on the native Windows desktop. This option is not
      compatible with using XDMCP.
    - Fullscreen [-fullscreen]
      Launches the X server fullscreen.
    - Windowed
      Launches the X server in its own window.
    - Nodecoration [-nodecoration]
      Launches the X server in its own window with no titlebar.

    XDMCPBroadcast (boolean) [-broadcast]
    Enables XDMCP and broadcasts BroadcastQuery packets to the network. The
    first responding display manager will be chosen for the session. Only
    applies if ClientMode is set to XDMCP.

    XDMCPIndirect (boolean) [-indirect | -query]
    Enables XDMCP and sends IndirectQuery packets to the host specified by
    XDMCPHost. If disabled, instead sends Query packets. Only applies if
    ClientMode is set to XDMCP and XDMCPBroadcast is disabled.

    XDMCPHost (string) [<hostname>]
    The hostname to send Query or IndirectQuery packets to. Only applies if
    ClientMode is set to XDMCP and XDMCPBroadcast is disabled.

    XDMCPTerminate (boolean) [-terminate]
    Terminate the server instead of resetting when the XDMCP sessions ends.
    Only applies if ClientMode is set to XDMCP.

    Clipboard (boolean) [-clipboard | -noclipboard]
    Start the integrated clipboard manager.

    Wgl (boolean) [-wgl | -nowgl]
    Use hardware-accelerated OpenGL rendering. You should also export the
    LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT environment variable.

    DisableAC (boolean) [-ac]
    Disables host-based access control. This enables access by any host, and
    permits any host to modify the access control list. Use extreme caution!

    ExtraParams (string) [<params>]
    Extra parameters provided to the X server.

    |========================|
    | X client configuration |
    |========================|

    ClientMode (string)
    Configures how X clients will be started:
    - NoClient
      Does not start any initial clients (you can start them later).
    - StartProgram
      Starts a local or remote program as indicated by LocalClient.
    - XDMCP
      Starts a remote XDMCP session. This option is not compatible with an X
      server running in MultiWindow mode.

    LocalClient (boolean)
    If enabled, indicates a local program specified by LocalProgram will be
    launched after starting the X client. If disabled, a remote program will be
    launched as specified by RemoteProgram and its associated settings.

    LocalProgram (string)
    Command to run to start a program on the local computer after launching the
    X client. Only applies if ClientMode is set to StartProgram and LocalClient
    is enabled.

    RemoteProgram (string)
    Command to run to start a program on a remote computer after launching the
    X client. Only applies if ClientMode is set to StartProgram and LocalClient
    is disabled.

    RemoteHost (string)
    Address of the remote computer. Only applies when using RemoteProgram.

    RemoteUser (string)
    Username on the remote computer. Only applies when using RemoteProgram.

    RemoteProtocol (string)
    Protocol for the remote computer. Only applies when using RemoteProgram.
    Valid options are "rsh" and "ssh".

    SSHKeyChain (boolean)
    Use keychain to contact ssh-agent for login to the remote computer. Only
    applies when RemoteProtocol is set to "ssh".

    SSHTerminal (boolean)
    Launch the SSH connection via a terminal. This is required for interactive
    authentication. Only applies when RemoteProtocol is set to "ssh".

    ExtraSSH (string)
    Extra parameters for the SSH client. Only applies when RemoteProtocol is
    set to "ssh".
