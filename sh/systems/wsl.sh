# Helper function to setup SSH agent forwarding
# Based on: https://github.com/rupor-github/wsl-ssh-agent#wsl-2-compatibility
#
# We need to retrieve the Linux equivalent path of the npiperelay executable
# which exists on the Windows host. Two methods of doing so are implemented.
#
# Approach #1: WSLENV (preferred)
# Requires the WSL_NPIPERELAY_PATH environment variable on the Windows system
# be set to the absolute path to npiperelay.exe. Also, the WSLENV environment
# variable must be set to pass it through to WSL when invoked from Win32, and
# perform the path translation. For example: "WSLENV=WSL_NPIPERELAY_PATH/pu".
#
# This method has the advantage of requiring no additional support utilities in
# the distribution, as the path is resolved on the host and passed in by WSL.
# It's also faster as no utilities need to be run to resolve the path on each
# spawned shell. However, WSLENV support is only available since Windows 10,
# Version 1803. If you aren't running this though, you need to upgrade!
#
# Approach #2: wslpath & wslvar (fallback)
# Uses the wslvar utility to retrieve the APPDATA environment variable from the
# Win32 environment, and the wslpath utility to translate it to the Linux path.
# The final path is assumed to be: "$APPDATA/Go/bin/npiperelay.exe".
#
# This can work on any WSL release, but requires the relevant WSL utilities to
# be available (wslpath & wslvar). The latter is no longer included by default
# since Ubuntu 22.04, requiring extra steps to install it. It's also slower as
# multiple programs have to be executed on each spawned shell.
