# ARGS: $1 (required): Path(s) to join with the second argument
#       $2 (optional): Path(s) to join with the first argument
#       $3 (optional): Set to any value to add the path(s) provided in the
#                      first argument to the start of the constructed list of
#                      paths, removing any duplicate paths which already were
#                      present in the path string. If unset, the paths will be
#                      added only if they did not already exist in the list of
#                      paths in the second argument, preserving the existing
#                      ordering of paths. If a path is present multiple times
#                      in the second argument the first instance of the path
#                      will be used, and subsequent instances are removed.
